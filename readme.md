Followed @olayinkos tutorial to create this. 

It connects to [Pusher](https://www.pusher.com) to display realtime leaderboard table. 

You can follow [through with the tutorial here](https://blog.pusher.com/build-a-realtime-table-using-laravel-and-pusher/ "build-a-realtime-table-using-laravel-and-pusher")
